RE: About Rouls of using Window on America
 
Dear Honorable Ambassador,
I would like to extend my thanks to you for your excellent speech, marking the 40th anniversary of the historic Weston Hotel. It was truly an honor to have you with us, and your presence made the celebration all the more memorable.
For me, your gracious attendance at the celebration reaffirms the true strength of Canadian-American relations. To have such a strong, productive relationship is a great source of reassurance.
As you know, the Weston Hotel is rather close to the border between our two countries, and visitors from the United States form a large part of our clientele. To have such deep connections between the two countries can only do the hotel good.
Moreover, the efforts you have undertaken to improve Canadian-American tourist relations are exemplary. I know for a fact that my fellow hoteliers find your work extremely commendable. For my part, I can do nothing but express the same admiration.
To close, I would again like to express my gratitude and to congratulate you on the remarkable progress you’ve made to strengthen the bilateral relations between Canada and America.
Please know that I hope for nothing but your continued success.
 
Sincerely yours,
Robert Anders Weston
Chairman and CEO, Weston Group of Companies

### James Damore | Любош Мотл предлагает Дамору миллион долларов.
I want to make it very clear: if you were in my reporting
chain, all of part (3) would have been replaced with a
short "this is not acceptable" and maybe that last
paragraph above. You would have heard part (3) in a much
smaller meeting, including you, me, your manager, your
HRBP, and someone from legal. And it would have ended with
you being escorted from the building by security and told
that your personal items will be mailed to you. And the
fact that you think this was "all in the name of open
discussion," and don't realize any of these deeper
consequences, makes this worse, not better.
